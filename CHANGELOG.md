# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Provider contract tests** (`npm run test:contract`) — a suite that calls
  real provider APIs to verify the things a mocked test cannot: that
  `listModels` speaks the shape we parse, that structured output returns
  parseable JSON, and that `embed` returns one vector per input. Both provider
  bugs found in 1.4.0 were wire-format mismatches invisible to mocked tests, and
  one of them had a green unit test asserting the wrong shape.

  Not part of CI and not required for development. Each provider block skips
  itself when its credential is absent, so `npm test` remains key-free and
  contributors with a single key exercise only that provider.

### Changed

- Settings → AI now says _why_ a capability is unavailable and what to do about
  it, instead of "nothing available". A self-hosted setup is told that research
  runs through SearXNG — which is accurate, since enrichment works through
  SearXNG even though no provider resolves for the capability.
- Pinning an embeddings model now probes it first and refuses the assignment if
  the provider cannot actually produce a vector. Compat servers advertise bare
  model ids, so embedding capability is guessed from the name; a model that
  looks right on a server without `/v1/embeddings` previously saved a pin that
  silently left the vector store on the old model.

### Fixed

- **Settings → AI reported embeddings as unavailable when it was working.** The
  view resolved every capability except embeddings, so the Auto row rendered an
  amber "nothing available" against a capability served correctly by the
  built-in local model. It now reads "Built-in local model · 384-dim".
- **OpenAI structured output was rejected outright.** The adapter sent
  `strict: true`, which requires `required` to list every key in `properties` —
  but Contrack's schemas have genuinely optional fields (a contact has a name;
  it may not have a company). Every schema-constrained OpenAI call failed with
  `400 Invalid schema for response_format`. As with the Anthropic bug, a unit
  test asserted the broken shape and stayed green. Found by the contract suite
  on its first run against a working key.
- **Changing the embeddings model left the dedupe index at the old width.** The
  settings route rebuilt only the search store, so `contact_embeddings` stayed
  at 384 while new vectors were 1536 and every insert failed with
  `Expected 384 dimensions but received 1536` until the process restarted. Both
  stores now rebuild together, with an integration test asserting they stay the
  same width.
- The integration suite no longer makes outbound network calls. Two tests
  stored a key for a built-in provider, which reached the real vendor to
  validate it — the only flaky tests in the suite. They now use a custom
  endpoint pointed at a closed port, which fails immediately and
  deterministically; real provider behaviour is covered by the contract suite.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-08-05

Contrack no longer asks you to pick "an AI provider". You connect whichever
services you have keys for, and each kind of work is routed to a suitable
model. One API key is still all you need — everything else is optional.

### Added

- **Capability-based AI configuration.** Four independent settings — Quick
  tasks, Deep tasks, Embeddings, and Web research — each resolved from
  Settings → AI, an environment variable, or automatically. Providers are no
  longer mutually exclusive; connect several and mix them across tasks.
- **Model discovery.** Saving an API key queries the provider's list-models
  endpoint, which validates the credential and fills the model dropdowns, so
  new releases appear without a Contrack update. Cached 24h, refreshable on
  demand, and populated in the background at startup. Gemini and Anthropic
  report capabilities directly; OpenAI-shaped servers are inferred from the
  model name and marked as guessed.
- **Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.** One adapter for Ollama, vLLM, LM
  Studio, llama.cpp, OpenRouter, xAI, DeepSeek, and Mistral — configured with
  a base URL and optional key. Structured output is negotiated per model
  (`json_schema` → `json_object` → prompt) and the working mode is remembered.
- **Self-hosted web research via SearXNG.** Point Contrack at a SearXNG
  instance to enrich contacts from the live web with no cloud provider. With a
  local chat model and the built-in embeddings, the entire AI stack can run on
  your own hardware.
- **Per-task model overrides:** `AI_QUICK_MODEL`, `AI_DEEP_MODEL`,
  `AI_RESEARCH_MODEL`, and `AI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL`, each accepting `model` or
  `provider:model`. Intended for declarative deployments; a pin made in
  Settings takes precedence.

### Changed

- **`.env.example` rewritten in tiers** — one key at the top, everything else
  optional and commented out. Previously it framed keys as conditional on
  `AI_PROVIDER`, implying you had to choose a provider before anything worked.
- **`AI_PROVIDER` is now only the Auto preference.** It selects which provider
  Auto favours when several keys are present, and does nothing with one key.
  Existing deployments are unaffected.
- **Settings → AI collapses to a single line** ("All tasks → provider, chosen
  automatically") with per-task controls behind a disclosure that opens
  automatically when anything is pinned.
- **Duplicate-detection embeddings now follow the Embeddings setting**, and
  default to the built-in local model. They previously called Gemini directly
  regardless of the setting, so choosing a local model still sent every
  contact to Google.
- Magic Paste output is now sanitized before it reaches a contact record —
  length caps, control-character stripping, injection-echo rejection, and URL
  validation.

### Fixed

Two of these affect data written by v1.3.0. If you ran that version, the
indexes below repair themselves automatically on first start.

- **Gemini embeddings returned one vector per batch instead of one per
  contact.** `contents: string[]` reads as a single Content with many parts,
  so each batch collapsed into one vector and the rest were silently dropped.
  Switching the Embeddings setting to a Gemini model left the semantic index
  almost entirely empty while reporting success.
- **Duplicate-detection embeddings had the same defect**, plus a backfill that
  only ran when the store was completely empty — so a partial index could
  never repair itself. On a 431-contact database it held 5 rows. Duplicate
  matching has been running without the semantic signal it was designed
  around. Restoring it raises match scores but crossed no auto-merge
  thresholds in testing (0 of 381 candidate pairs).
- **Anthropic structured output was broken entirely.** `output_config.format`
  takes the schema directly, but Contrack sent OpenAI's nested `json_schema`
  wrapper, so every JSON operation on Anthropic failed with a 400. Only
  text-only calls worked. Claude also caps schemas at 24 optional parameters,
  which the research schema exceeds; that case now falls back to
  prompt-guided JSON instead of failing.
- A provider returning fewer embeddings than inputs is now a hard error rather
  than a silently short batch, and the backfill refuses to write a partial
  index.
- OpenAI-compatible backends that return `200 OK` with a non-JSON body now
  trigger the structured-output downgrade, not just those that reject the
  format outright.
- Reasoning models (gemma-4, QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) that spend their whole token
  budget on `reasoning_content` now report that explicitly instead of
  surfacing as "malformed JSON".
- `data/` is excluded from version control — it holds the auth token,
  uploads, and backups.
- **Container images are now published for `linux/arm64` as well as
  `linux/amd64`.** Previous releases were amd64-only, so Apple Silicon and ARM
  homelab hosts could not pull them at all.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-08-04

### Added

- Trash view in Settings for restoring or permanently deleting contacts.
- Data lifecycle: soft-delete with retention purge, scheduled SQLite
  snapshots, and full JSON/CSV export.
- Single-user authentication (`AUTH_TOKEN` / `AUTH_REQUIRED`) with an
  HttpOnly cookie and bearer-token support for scripts.

### Changed

- TypeScript `strict` mode enabled across the codebase with real lint
  enforcement in CI.
- Integration tests run HTTP routes against a real SQLite database.
- Heavy startup work moved off the request thread.
- Documentation refresh and release-pipeline improvements.

### Fixed

- Prompt-injection hardening across the AI pipeline: untrusted content is
  fenced and model output is validated before it can be written.
- Soft-merged contacts no longer leak into contact lists.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-03

### Added

- Lite-tier model integration and an enhanced hybrid search pipeline.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-03
